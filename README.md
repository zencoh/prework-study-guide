## Description
This study guide was created to help boot camp students understand the basics of coding and prepare them for the actual class. This study guide has notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Personally I learned a lot about Git because it is something I had little experience with earlier and I wanted to be better because we will be using git for the duration of the class.
